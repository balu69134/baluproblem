JAVA IS PLATFORM INDEPENDENT LANGUAGE
JAVA PLATFORM INDEPENDENT THAT MEANS JVM ONE OPERATING SYSTEM CAN'T BE USED AS JVM OF ANOTHER OPERATION SYSTEM.

DATA TYPES
1.PRIMITVE 
2.NON-PRIMITIVE 
1.PRIMITIVE DATA TYPE
primitive data structure is considered as the fundamental data structure and it allows storing the values of only one data type 
INTEGERS            DECIMAL   CHARACTERS        BOOLEAN
INT SHORT            FLOAT       CHAR       TRUE OR FALSE

Ex:-byte a = 2;

2.NON-PRIMITIVE
non-primitive data structures are considered as the user-defined structure that allows storing values of different data types within one entity.
CLASSES AND INTERFACES
Array
String

TYPE OF CASTING

IMPLICITY CASTING:- A SMALL TO LARGE 
EXPLICITY  CASTING :- A LARGE TO SMALL


IN JAVA METHOD NAME FOLLOW CAMELCASE.
RETURN_TYPE
METHOD_NAME
PARAMETER
public static void main(parameters)
method body:-
method body contains actually code that is executed when the method calles based return types and parameters java methods can be classified  4 types
1). method without parameter and without return type.
public class ExampleClass {
    // Method without parameters and without return type
    public void printHello() {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an instance of ExampleClass
        ExampleClass example = new ExampleClass();

        // Call the method
        example.printHello();
    }
}


2). method with parameter and without return type.
package com.constructor.demo;

public class Solution {
	public void example( int  x , int y) {
		
		
		
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int x=3;
		int y=4;
		int sum=x+y;
		System.out.println(""+sum);
	
		

}
}


3).method without parameter and  with return type


package com.constructor.demo;

public class Solution {
	public void example( ) {
		
		
		
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int x=3;
		int y=4;
		int sum=x+y;
		System.out.println(""+sum);
	
		

}
}

4).method with parameter and  with return type.


package com.constructor.demo;

public class Solution {
	public int  example( int x , int y ) {
	
		int sum=x+y;
		return sum;
		
		
		
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Solution s=new Solution();
		int result=s.example(-2, -2);
		System.out.println(""+result);
	
		

}
}

Methodoverloading:-
method overlaoding is feature of java where a class contain more than one method with same name but different parameter

methodloading be executed by the compiler is purely based on four factors
1) Method name
2) Number of parameter
3) type of parameter
4) order of parameter

Methodoverloading provides several benefits
*Readbility code organization
*Methodoverloading allows to same method name for related operations making the code more readble anf organization.


Method Signature=Method name+Parameter.

Note:- In method overloading choosing of method to be by excuted by compiler is not dependented on the return type of method.

Oops:-Object oriented programming is approach which intends to solve real word problems with help of program 
Object oriented programming real word entities or represented as objects

Objects:- An object can be defined as programming representation of real word enities

Class:-- A class can be defined as  template and blue print based on the can which objects can be created


Constructors in java:-
Constructors special type of method in java name as same for the class but there was no return type  and that are used to initialize the objects
